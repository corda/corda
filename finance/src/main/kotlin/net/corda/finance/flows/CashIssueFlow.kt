/**
 * Initiates a flow that self-issues cash (which should then be sent to recipient(s) using a payment transaction).
 *
 * We issue cash only to ourselves so that all KYC/AML checks on payments are enforced consistently, rather than risk
 * checks for issuance and payments differing. Outside of test scenarios it would be extremely unusual to issue cash
 * and immediately transfer it, so impact of this limitation is considered minimal.
 *
 * @param amount the amount of currency to issue.
 * @param issuerBankPartyRef a reference to put on the issued currency.
 * @param notary the notary to set on the output states.

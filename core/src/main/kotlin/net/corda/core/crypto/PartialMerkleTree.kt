/**
 * Building and verification of Partial Merkle Tree.
 * Partial Merkle Tree is a minimal tree needed to check that a given set of leaves belongs to a full Merkle Tree.
 *
 * Example of Merkle tree with 5 leaves.
 *
 *             h15
 *          /       \
 *         h14       h55
 *        /  \      /  \
 *      h12  h34   h50 h00
 *     / \   / \   / \  / \
 *    l1 l2 l3 l4 l5 0 0  0
 *
 * l* denote hashes of leaves, h* - hashes of nodes below. 0 denotes zero hash, we use it to pad not full binary trees,
 * so the number of leaves is always a power of 2.
 *
 * Example of Partial tree based on the tree above.
 *
 *             ___
 *          /       \
 *          _        _
 *        /  \      /  \
 *      h12   _     _   h00
 *           / \   / \
 *          I3 l4 I5 0
 *
 * We want to check l3 and l5 - now turned into IncudedLeaf (I3 and I5 above). To verify that these two leaves belong to
 * the tree with a hash root h15 we need to provide a Merkle branch (or partial tree). In our case we need hashes:
 * h12, l4, 0 and h00. Verification is done by hashing the partial tree to obtain the root and checking it against
 * the obtained h15 hash. Additionally we store included hashes used in calculation and compare them to leaves hashes we got
 * (there can be a difference in obtained leaves ordering - that's why it's a set comparison not hashing leaves into a tree).
 * If both equalities hold, we can assume that l3 and l5 belong to the transaction with root h15.

     * or cut subtree node with stored hash. We differentiate between the leaves that are included in a filtered
     * transaction and leaves that just keep hashes needed for calculation. Reason for this approach: during verification
     * it's easier to extract hashes used as a base for this tree.

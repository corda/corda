/**
 * A threadbox is a simple utility that makes it harder to forget to take a lock before accessing some shared state.
 * Simply define a private class to hold the data that must be grouped under the same lock, and then pass the only
 * instance to the ThreadBox constructor. You can now use the [locked] method with a lambda to take the lock in a
 * way that ensures it'll be released if there's an exception.
 *
 * Note that this technique is not infallible: if you capture a reference to the fields in another lambda which then
 * gets stored and invoked later, there may still be unsafe multi-threaded access going on, so watch out for that.
 * This is just a simple guard rail that makes it harder to slip up.
 *
 * Example:
 *```
 * private class MutableState { var i = 5 }
 * private val state = ThreadBox(MutableState())
 *
 * val ii = state.locked { i }
 * ```

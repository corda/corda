/**
 * A custom ClassLoader that knows how to load classes from a set of attachments. The attachments themselves only
 * need to provide JAR streams, and so could be fetched from a database, local disk, etc. Constructing an
 * AttachmentsClassLoader is somewhat expensive, as every attachment is scanned to ensure that there are no overlapping
 * file paths. In addition, every JAR is scanned to ensure that it doesn't violate the package namespace ownership
 * rules.
 *
 * @property params The network parameters fetched from the transaction for which this classloader was built.
 * @property sampleTxId The transaction ID that triggered the creation of this classloader. Because classloaders are cached
 *           this tx may be stale, that is, classloading might be triggered by the verification of some other transaction
 *           if not all code is invoked every time, however we want a txid for errors in case of attachment bogusness.

/**
 * A StateMachineManager is responsible for coordination and persistence of multiple [FlowStateMachine] objects.
 * Each such object represents an instantiation of a (two-party) flow that has reached a particular point.
 *
 * An implementation of this interface will persist state machines to long term storage so they can survive process
 * restarts and, if run with a single-threaded executor, will ensure no two state machines run concurrently with each
 * other (bad for performance, good for programmer mental health!).
 *
 * A flow is a class with a single call method. The call method and any others it invokes are rewritten by a bytecode
 * rewriting engine called Quasar, to ensure the code can be suspended and resumed at any point.
 *
 * TODO: Consider the issue of continuation identity more deeply: is it a safe assumption that a serialised continuation is always unique?
 * TODO: Think about how to bring the system to a clean stop so it can be upgraded without any serialised stacks on disk
 * TODO: Timeouts
 * TODO: Surfacing of exceptions via an API and/or management UI
 * TODO: Don't store all active flows in memory, load from the database on demand.

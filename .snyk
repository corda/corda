          The vulnerability in okhttp’s error handling is only exploitable in
          services that receive and parse HTTP requests. Corda does not receive
          HTTP requests and thus is not exposed to this issue.

    - '*':
        reason: >-
          Corda does not rely on hostname verification in the P2P protocol to
          identify a host, so is not impacted by this vulnerability. Corda uses
          its own SSL identity check logic for the network model. Corda
          validates based on the full X500 subject name and the fact that P2P
          links use mutually authenticated TLS with the same trust roots. For
          RPC SSL client connections Artemis is used which calls into netty. The
          default value for verifyHost is true for Artemis client connectors so
          verification of the host name in netty does occur.

          This is a build time vulnerability. It relates to the inability to
          lock dependencies for Kotlin Multiplatform Gradle Projects. At build
          time for Corda we do not use Multiplatform Gradle Projects so are not
          affected by this vulnerability. In addition as it is a build time
          vulnerability released artifacts are not affected.

          This component is used to upgrade the node database schema either at
          node startup or via the database migration tool. The XML input for the
          database migration is generated by Corda from either R3 supplied XML
          files included in corda.jar or those XML files written by the CorDapp
          author included in a CorDapp that is installed in the node CorDapps
          directory. Contract CorDapps received over the network are not a
          source of XML files for this generation step.  An attacker trying to
          exploit this vulnerability would need access to the server with the
          XML input files, and specifically the access and ability to change JAR
          files on the file system that make up the Corda installation.

          Corda is not susceptible to this vulnerability. If CorDapp developers

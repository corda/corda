// will get as far as the Capsule version checks, meaning that if your JVM is too old, you will at least get
// a sensible error message telling you what to do rather than a bytecode version exception that doesn't.
// If we introduce .java files into this module that need Java 8+ then we will have to push the caplet into
// its own module so its target can be controlled individually, but for now this suffices.

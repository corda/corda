        <p>Intel(R) Software Guard Extensions (Intel(R) SGX) is an Intel technology for application developers seeking to protect select code and data from disclosure or 
modification. Intel(R) SGX makes such protections possible through the use of 
enclaves. Enclaves are protected areas of execution. Application code can be put 
into an enclave through special instructions and software made available to 
developers by the Intel(R) SGX SDK.</p>

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>This <i>Developer Guide</i> is intended for use by Independent Service Vendors who wish to harden their Linux* applications using Intel(R) SGX Technology, code named Intel(R) Software Guard Extensions. The guide describes the procedure for installation of Intel(R) SGX Plugin for Eclipse* IDE and development of Intel(R) SGX components using the plugin. The Intel(R) SGX Plugin for Eclipse leverages on the Intel(R) Software Guard Extensions SDK, which is a collection of APIs, libraries and tools that enable you to develop, build and debug Intel(R) SGX applications in C/C++.</p>
        <p>To learn more about the Intel(R) Software Guard Extensions SDK, see the <i>Intel(R) Software Guard Extensions SDK for Linux* OS Developer Reference</i>.</p>&#160;</div>

        <h2>Introducing Intel(R) Software Guard Extensions</h2>
        <p>Intel(R) Software Guard Extensions is a new Intel technology, whose objective is to enable a high level of protection of secrets. It operates by allocating hardware-protected memory where code and data reside. The protected memory area within an application process is called an enclave. Data within the enclave memory can only be accessed by code that resides within that enclave. Enclave code can be invoked by special instructions.</p>
        <p>An enclave can be built and loaded as a shared object.</p>
        <p>Throughout this document, Intel(R) SGX refers to Intel(R) Software Guard Extensions.</p>
        <p>An Intel(R) SGX application design is different from the design of non- Intel(R) SGX application as it specifies dividing the application into two logical parts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><i>Trusted</i> part. The code that accesses the secret resides here and it is called an enclave. More than one enclave can exist in an application.</li>
            <li><i>Untrusted</i> part. This includes the rest of the modules in the application, that is outside in an enclave.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The trusted components and untrusted components are developed as separate modules.</p>
        <p>The trusted part or the enclave is implemented in C or C++. It is supplied as a collection of functions and data packaged in the form of a dynamically loaded library, a DLL in Windows* OS and a shared object in Linux* OS. It may be supplied either as a pre-built signed library or as a signed shared library built during compilation of the untrusted component.</p>
        <p>Enclave functions within an enclave library are wrapped by auto-generated proxy and bridge functions that simplify the mechanism of using the Intel(R) SGX technology by developers.</p>
        <p>The role of these functions is to handle the following tasks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Call an enclave function from untrusted code, also called an ECALL (enclave call).</li>
            <li>Call an untrusted function from within an enclave, also called an OCALL (outside call).</li>
            <li>Handle interrupts.</li>
            <li>Handle exceptions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The proxy and bridge functions are generated by the <code>sgx_edger8r</code> tool provided by Intel(R) SGX SDK. It reads an <i>edl</i> file (Enclave Descriptor Language) which describes the functions that form the <i>trusted</i> and <i>untrusted</i> component boundaries within the application.</p>
        <p>After the enclave is built, a signed version of it is created using the tool <code>sgx_sign</code> also provided by Intel(R) SGX SDK.  It is this signed version may be loaded and executed in the encrypted memory.</p>
        <p>Enclaves may have some specific properties which are added as meta-information during the signing process.  The meta-information is stored in one configuration xml file per enclave. See more details about meta-information in <i>Intel(R) Software Guard Extensions SDK for Linux* OS Developer Reference</i>.</p>

    <div id='Introducing_Intel_Software_Guard_Extensions'>
        <h2>Introducing Intel(R) Software Guard Extensions Eclipse* Plug-in</h2>
        <p>The Intel(R) Software Guard Extensions Eclipse* Plug-in helps the enclave developer to maintain enclaves and untrusted related code inside Eclipse* C/C++ projects.   To use this support, add Intel(R) SGX nature to the C/C++ project.  See <a href="#Adding_SGX_Nature_to_a_Project">Adding Intel(R) SGX Nature to a Project</a> for details.</p>
        <p>Once the Intel(R) SGX nature is added to a project, you will have access to the Intel(R) SGX commands.  Intel(R) SGX nature adds also a folder called <code>sgx</code> to the root of the project, and a Makefile inside it.   All resources of the project managed by Intel(R) Software Guard Extensions Eclipse Plug-in are located inside this directory.  You can build and run enclaves related code using GNU* Make tool through the Makefile.</p>
        <p>The plugin is generating minimal but ready-to-work code skeletons, complete with their own Makefile having all the required make targets as to call <code>sgx_edger8r</code> tool to generate the proxies and bridges, compile these source, generate a shared object and finally, to sign the enclave with the <code>sgx_sign</code> tool.  This provide a starting point you may build upon.</p>

        <h2>Adding Intel(R) SGX Nature to a Project</h2>
        <p>The <i>nature</i> of an Eclipse project is a concept defined by an Eclipse Platform which allows a plug-in to tag a project as a specific kind of project.   Intel(R) Software Guard Extensions  uses an <i>Intel(R) SGX nature</i> to add Intel(R) SGX-specific behavior to projects.  Project natures are defined by plug-ins, and are typically added or removed per-project when the user performs some action defined by the plug-in.</p>
        <p>To use Intel(R) Software Guard Extensions Eclipse Plug-in in your project, you need to add Intel(R) SGX nature to it.   You may either add Intel(R) SGX nature to a pre-existing C/C++ project or create a project with Intel(R) SGX nature from start.  See <a href="#Adding_SGX_Nature_to_a_non_SGX_project">Adding Intel(R) SGX Nature to a non-SGX project</a> and <a href="#Creating_a_New_C_C_Project_with_SGX_Nature">Creating a New C/C++ Project with Intel(R) SGX Nature</a> for how to complete these tasks.</p>

        <h2>Two Steps Sign Enclave</h2>
        <p>To help you develop enclaves, Intel(R) Software Guard Extensions Eclipse Plug-in generates all required structure including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>c/c++ files and header files</li>
            <li><code>.edl</code> file</li>

            <li>a sample Makefile</li>
            <li>a sample signing key</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While these structure might be appropriate for development and debugging, you need a 2-step process to integrate your own signing schema for generating  production enclaves.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Generate hash: the signer tool generates signing material from the unsigned compiled enclave and from the configuration file for the enclave.  The signed material comes as an opaque sequence of bytes which are put in a file with extension <code>.hex</code>. This file is used with the external signing facility.  You come back with a signature for the <code>.hex</code> file plus the public key of your signing facility, and proceed to Step 2.</li>
            <li>Generate signed enclaves : the signer tool generates the final signed enclave.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To complete this task, provide the following input parameters:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The unsigned enclave</li>
            <li>The configuration file</li>
            <li>The output file produced when you generate hash (the <code>.hex</code> file)</li>
            <li>The files produced by the external signing facility: the signature of the .hex file and public key for it</li>
            <li>The plugin checks if the input parameters are consistent:</li>
            <li>The <code>.hex</code> file matches the unsigned enclave and the configuration file,</li>
            <li>The signed material is verified with the public key</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the parameters are consistent, the production signed enclave is produced.</p>
        <div class="NoteCont">
            <p class="NoteTipHead">NOTE:</p>
            <p>If you generate signed enclave right after generating hash, you can only enter the parameters specific for generating signed enclave.</p>

        <h1>Building and Running Intel(R) SGX Code</h1>
        <p>This section describes the following topics about building and running Intel(R) SGX code:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Intel(R) SGX build configurations</li>
            <li>Running samples generated for enclaves</li>
        </ul>&#160;</div>
    <div id='SGX_Build_Configurations'>
        <h2>Intel(R) SGX Build Configurations</h2>
        <p>There are usually two types of builds that a regular non-SGX project defines:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Debug</li>
            <li>Release</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Intel(R) SGX-enabled projects add to this picture support to build and test Intel(R) SGX-enabled application on non-SGX platforms (or emulator) using simulation libraries. This approach doubles the set of build types, creating four possible combinations.  For these combinations, you need to use different sets of compilation and  linking flags and link different libraries.</p>
        <p>The non-debug hardware build is meant to give production code, so it requires the maximum attention when signed. The Two Steps Sign schema is required for production enclaves, which involves an external signing facility, not part of Intel(R) SGX SDK.  The other configurations are not meant for production but they have to be signed too.  The simplest and more convenient Single Step schema is used for them.</p>
        <p>Again for testing purpose, you might want to experiment with a non-production enclave built with release compilation and linking flags, on a real hardware Intel(R) SGX-enabled platform. That would be an enclave built exactly as a production enclave, except for the sign process which would be Single Step. To support the construction of such enclave, there is a hardware non-debug build configuration dubbed <i>Prerelease</i>.</p>
        <p>So there are five Intel(R) SGX related configurations when Intel(R) SGX Nature is added to a project:</p>

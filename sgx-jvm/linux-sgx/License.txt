CC0 1.0 Universal

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. 
DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. 
CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS 
MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS 
PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF 
THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.

Statement of Purpose
The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive 
Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) 
(each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, 
a "Work").
Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose 
of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") 
that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build 
upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible 
in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial 
purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free 
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to 
gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and 
efforts of others.
For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of 
additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work 
(the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related 
Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute 
the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights 
in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by 
copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). 
Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:
i.	the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
 and translate a Work;
ii.	moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
iii.	publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness 
depicted in a Work;
iv.	rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject 
to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
v.	rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
vi.	database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European 
Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, 
and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor 
version of such directive); and
vii.	other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on 
applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable 
law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, 
abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated 
claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as 
future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for 
the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions),
 (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose
 whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes 
(the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at 
large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such 
Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any 
other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public 
as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally 
invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the 
maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In 
addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected 
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable 
and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the 
Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable 
law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and 
for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation 
commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed 
effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the 
License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such 
partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, 
and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his 
or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated 
claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's 
express Statement of Purpose.
4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
a.	No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, 
licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
b.	Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any 
kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation 
warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or 
the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether 
or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
c.	Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply 

to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related 
Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary 
consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
d.	Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this 
document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.

http://openbsd.org/

OpenBSD* Copyright Policy
________________________________________
-	Goal
Copyright law is complex, OpenBSD* policy is simple - OpenBSD strives to maintain the spirit 
of the original Berkeley Unix copyrights.
OpenBSD can exist as it does today because of the example set by the Computer Systems Research 
Group at Berkeley and the battles which they and others fought to create a relatively 
un-encumbered Unix source distribution.
The ability of a freely redistributable "Berkeley" Unix to move forward on a competitive 
basis with other operating systems depends on the willingness of the various development 
groups to exchange code amongst themselves and with other projects. Understanding the legal 
issues surrounding copyright is fundamental to the ability to exchange and re-distribute code, 
while honoring the spirit of the copyright and concept of attribution is fundamental to 
promoting the cooperation of the people involved.
-	The Berkeley* Copyright
The Berkeley* copyright poses no restrictions on private or commercial use of the software 
and imposes only simple and uniform requirements for maintaining copyright notices in 
redistributed versions and crediting the originator of the material only in advertising.
For instance:
 * Copyright (c) 1982, 1986, 1990, 1991, 1993
 *	The Regents of the University of California.  All rights reserved.
 *
 * Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without
 * modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions
 * are met:
 * 1. Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright
 *    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.
 * 2. Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright
 *    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the
 *    documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.
 * 3. All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software
 *    must display the following acknowledgement:
 *	This product includes software developed by the University of
 *	California, Berkeley and its contributors.
 * 4. Neither the name of the University nor the names of its contributors
 *    may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software
 *    without specific prior written permission.
 *
 * THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE REGENTS AND CONTRIBUTORS ``AS IS'' AND
 * ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
 * IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
 * ARE DISCLAIMED.  IN NO EVENT SHALL THE REGENTS OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE
 * FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
 * DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS
 * OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION)
 * HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT
 * LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
 * OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
 * SUCH DAMAGE.
 *
Berkeley rescinded the 3rd term (the advertising term) on 22 July 1999. Verbatim copies 
of the Berkeley license in the OpenBSD tree have that term removed. In addition, many 
3rd-party BSD-style licenses consist solely of the first two terms.
Because the OpenBSD copyright imposes no conditions beyond those imposed by the Berkeley 
copyright, OpenBSD can hope to share the same wide distribution and applicability as the 
Berkeley distributions. It follows however, that OpenBSD cannot include material which 
includes copyrights which are more restrictive than the Berkeley copyright, or must 
relegate this material to a secondary status, i.e. OpenBSD as a whole is freely 
redistributable, but some optional components may not be.
-	Copyright Law
While the overall subject of copyright law is far beyond the scope of this document, some 
basics are in order. Under the current copyright law, copyrights are implicit in the 
creation of a new work and reside with the creator, unless otherwise assigned. In general 
the copyright applies only to the new work, not the material the work was derived from, 
nor those portions of the derivative material included in the new work.
Copyright law admits to three general categories of works:
Original Work
A new work that is not derived from an existing work.
Derivative Work
Work that is derived from, includes or amends existing works.
Compilations
A work that is a compilation of existing new and derivative works.
The fundamental concept is that there is primacy of the copyright, that is a copyright of a 
derivative work does not affect the rights held by the owner of the copyright of the original 
work, rather only the part added. Likewise the copyright of a compilation does not affect the 
rights of the owner of the included works, only the compilation as an entity.
It is vitally important to understand that copyrights are broad protections as defined by 
national and international copyright law. The "copyright notices" usually included in source 
files are not copyrights, but rather notices that a party asserts that they hold copyright 
to the material or to part of the material. Typically these notices are associated with 
license terms which grant permissions subject to copyright law and with disclaimers that 
state the position of the copyright holder/distributor with respect to liability surrounding 
use of the material.
-	Permissions - the flip side
Because copyrights arise from the creation of a work, rather than through a registration process, 
there needs to be a practical way to extend permission to use a work beyond what might be allowed 
by "fair use" provisions of the copyright laws.
This permission typically takes the form of a "release" or "license" included in the work, which 
grants the additional uses beyond those granted by copyright law, usually subject to a variety of 
conditions. At one extreme sits "public domain" where the originator asserts that he imposes no 
restrictions on use of the material, at the other restrictive clauses that actually grant no 
additional rights or impose restrictive, discriminatory or impractical conditions on use of the 
work.
Again, an important point to note is that the release and conditions can only apply to the 
portion of the work that was originated by the copyright holder - the holder of a copyright 
on a derivative work can neither grant additional permissions for use of the original work, 
nor impose more restrictive conditions for use of that work.
Because copyright arises from the creation of a work and not the text or a registration process, 
removing or altering a copyright notice or associated release terms has no bearing on the 
existence of the copyright, rather all that is accomplished is to cast doubt upon whatever rights 
the person making the modifications had to use the material in the first place. Likewise, adding 
terms and conditions in conflict with the original terms and conditions does not supersede them, 
rather it casts doubts on the rights of the person making the amendments to use the material and 
creates confusion as to whether anyone can use the amended version or derivatives thereof.
Finally, releases are generally binding on the material that they are distributed with. This means 
that if the originator of a work distributes that work with a release granting certain permissions, 
those permissions apply as stated, without discrimination, to all persons legitimately possessing 
a copy of the work. That means that having granted a permission, the copyright holder can not 
retroactively say that an individual or class of individuals are no longer granted those permissions. 
Likewise should the copyright holder decide to "go commercial" he can not revoke permissions already 
granted for the use of the work as distributed, though he may impose more restrictive permissions in 
his future distributions of that work.
-	Specific Cases
This section attempts to summarize the position of OpenBSD relative to some commonly encountered 
copyrights.
Berkeley*
The Berkeley copyright is the model for the OpenBSD copyright. It retains the rights of the 
copyright holder, while imposing minimal conditions on the use of the copyrighted material. 
Material with Berkeley copyrights, or copyrights closely adhering to the Berkeley model can 
generally be included in OpenBSD.
AT&amp;T*
As part of its settlement with AT&amp;T*, Berkeley included an AT&amp;T copyright notice on some of the 
files in 4.4BSD lite and lite2. The terms of this license are identical to the standard Berkeley 
license.
Additionally, OpenBSD includes some other AT&amp;T code with non-restrictive copyrights, such as the 
reference implementation of awk.
Caldera*
Caldera* (now known as the SCO group) is the current owner of the Unix code copyrights. On 23 
January 2002, the original Unix code (versions 1 through seven, including 32V) was freed by Caldera. 
This code is now available under a 4-term BSD-style license. As a result, it is now possible to 
incorporate real Unix code into OpenBSD (though this code is quite old and generally requires significant 
changes to bring it up to date).
DEC*, Sun*, other manufacturers/software houses.
In general OpenBSD does not include material copyrighted by manufacturers or software houses. 
Material may be included where the copyright owner has granted general permission for reuse 
without conditions, with terms similar to the Berkeley copyright, or where the material is the 
product of an employee and the employer's copyright notice effectively releases any rights they 
might have to the work.
Carnegie-Mellon* (CMU, Mach)
The Carnegie-Mellon copyright is similar to the Berkeley copyright, except that it requests that 
derivative works be made available to Carnegie-Mellon. Because this is only a request and not a 
condition, such material can still be included in OpenBSD. It should be noted that existing 
versions of Mach are still subject to AT&amp;T copyrights, which prevents the general distribution 
of Mach sources.
Apache*
The original Apache* copyright is similar to the Berkeley copyright, except that it stipulates 
that products derived from the code may not have "Apache" in their name. The purpose of this 
clause is to avoid a situation in which another party releases a modified version of the code 
named in such a way to make users think that it is the "official" version. This is not an issue 
with OpenBSD because OpenBSD is a Compilation, and not a Derived Work. Source code published under 
version 2 of the Apache license cannot be included into OpenBSD. As a consequence, OpenBSD now 
maintains its own version of Apache based on version 1.3.29. The OpenBSD version includes many 
enhancements and bugfixes.
ISC*
The ISC* copyright is functionally equivalent to a two-term BSD copyright with language removed 
that is made unnecessary by the Berne convention. This is the preferred license for new code 
incorporated into OpenBSD. A sample license is included in the source tree as 
/usr/src/share/misc/license.template.
GNU* General Public License, GPL, LGPL, copyleft, etc.
The GNU* Public License and licenses modeled on it impose the restriction that source code must 
be distributed or made available for all works that are derivatives of the GNU copyrighted code.
While this may be a noble strategy in terms of software sharing, it is a condition that is 
typically unacceptable for commercial use of software. As a consequence, software bound by the 
GPL terms can not be included in the kernel or "runtime" of OpenBSD, though software subject to
 GPL terms may be included as development tools or as part of the system that are "optional" as 
long as such use does not result in OpenBSD as a whole becoming subject to the GPL terms.
As an example, GCC and other GNU tools are included in the OpenBSD tool chain. However, it is 
quite possible to distribute a system for many applications without a tool chain, or the 
distributor can choose to include a tool chain as an optional bundle which conforms to the 
GPL terms.
NetBSD*
Much of OpenBSD is originally based on and evolved from NetBSD*, since some of the OpenBSD 
developers were involved in the NetBSD project. The general NetBSD license terms are compatible 
with the Berkeley license and permit such use. Material subject only to the general NetBSD license 
can generally be included in OpenBSD.
In the past, NetBSD has included material copyrighted by individuals who have imposed license 
conditions beyond that of the general NetBSD license, but granted the NetBSD Foundation license 
to distribute the material. Such material can not be included in OpenBSD as long as the conditions 
imposed are at odds with the OpenBSD license terms or releases from those terms are offered on a 
discriminatory basis.
FreeBSD*
Most of FreeBSD* is also based on Berkeley licensed material or includes copyright notices based 
on the Berkeley model. Such material can be included in OpenBSD, while those parts that are subject 
to GPL or various individual copyright terms that are at odds with the OpenBSD license can not be 
included in OpenBSD.
Linux*
Most of Linux* is subject to GPL style licensing terms and therefore can not be included in 
OpenBSD. Individual components may be eligible, subject to the terms of the originator's copyright 
notices. Note that Linux "distributions" may also be subject to additional copyright claims of the 
distributing organization, either as a compilation or on material included that is not part of the 
Linux core.
X*, XFree86*, X.Org*
X*, X.Org* or XFree86* are not parts of OpenBSD, rather X.Org and parts of XFree86 3.3.6 are 
distributed with many OpenBSD ports as a convenience to the user, subject to applicable license 
terms.
Shareware, Charityware, Freeware, etc.
Most "shareware" copyright notices impose conditions for redistribution, use or visibility that 
are at conflict with the OpenBSD project goals. Review on a case-by-case basis is required as to 
whether the wording of the conditions is acceptable in terms of conditions being requested vs. 
demanded and whether the spirit of the conditions is compatible with goals of the OpenBSD project.
Public Domain
While material that is truly entered into the "Public Domain" can be included in OpenBSD, review 
is required on a case by case basis. Frequently the "public domain" assertion is made by someone 
who does not really hold all rights under Copyright law to grant that status or there are a variety
of conditions imposed on use. For a work to be truly in the "Public Domain" all rights are abandoned 
and the material is offered without restrictions.

  LICENSE ISSUES
  ==============

  The OpenSSL* toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of
  the OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit.
  See below for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style
  Open Source licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL
  please contact openssl-core@openssl.org.

11. SQLite

http://sqlite.org/

SQLite* Copyright

All of the code and documentation in SQLite has been dedicated to the public 
domain by the authors. All code authors, and representatives of the companies 
they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the 
public domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe 
at the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, 
compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code 
form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, 
and by any means.
The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code and documentation in 
SQLite - those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship 
with a larger application. Some scripts used as part of the build process 
(for example the "configure" scripts generated by autoconf) might fall under 
other open-source licenses. Nothing from these build scripts ever reaches the 
final deliverable SQLite library, however, and so the licenses associated with 
those scripts should not be a factor in assessing your rights to copy and use 
the SQLite library.
All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code 
has been taken from other projects or from the open internet. Every line of 
code can be traced back to its original author, and all of those authors have 
public domain dedications on file. So the SQLite code base is clean and is 
uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.

Version 2, June 1991
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify

      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

17. Eclipse Plug-in

Eclipse Public License - v 1.0

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
i) changes to the Program, and
ii) additions to the Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
b) its license agreement:
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

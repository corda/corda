/**
 * Wrapper over [CordaRPCOps] that handles exceptions when the node or the connection to the node fail.
 *
 * All operations are retried on failure, except flow start operations that die before receiving a valid [FlowHandle], in which case a
 * [CouldNotStartFlowException] is thrown.
 *
 * When calling methods that return a [DataFeed] like [CordaRPCOps.vaultTrackBy], the returned [DataFeed.updates] object will no longer
 * be a usable [rx.Observable] but an instance of [ReconnectingObservable].
 * The caller has to explicitly cast to [ReconnectingObservable] and call [ReconnectingObservable.subscribe]. If used as an [rx.Observable]
 * it will just fail.
 * The returned [DataFeed.snapshot] is the snapshot as it was when the feed was first retrieved.
 *
 * Note: There is no guarantee that observations will not be lost.
 *
 * *This class is not a stable API. Any project that wants to use it, must copy and paste it.*

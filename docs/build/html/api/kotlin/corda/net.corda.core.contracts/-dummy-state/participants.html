<p>A <emph>participant</emph> is any party that is able to consume this state in a valid transaction.</p>
<p>The list of participants is required for certain types of transactions. For example, when changing the notary
for this state (<a href="../-transaction-type/-notary-change/index.html">TransactionType.NotaryChange</a>), every participant has to be involved and approve the transaction
so that they receive the updated state, and don't end up in a situation where they can no longer use a state
they possess, since someone consumed that state during the notary change process.</p>
<p>The participants list should normally be derived from the contents of the state. E.g. for <a href="#">Cash</a> the participants
list should just contain the owner.</p>

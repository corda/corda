<p>No pre-commit processing is done. Transaction is not checked for contract-validity, as that would require fully
resolving it into a <a href="#">TransactionForVerification</a>, for which the caller would have to reveal the whole transaction
history chain.
As a result, the Notary <emph>will commit invalid transactions</emph> as well, but as it also records the identity of
the caller, it is possible to raise a dispute and verify the validity of the transaction and subsequently
undo the commit of the input states (the exact mechanism still needs to be worked out).</p>

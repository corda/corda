The Corda Configuration File
============================

Configuration File Location
---------------------------

The Corda all-in-one ``corda.jar`` file is generated by the ``gradle buildCordaJAR`` task and defaults to reading configuration from a ``node.conf`` file in the present working directory.
This behaviour can be overidden using the ``--config-file`` command line option to target configuration files with different names, or different file location (relative paths are relative to the current working directory).
Also, the ``--base-directory`` command line option alters the Corda node workspace location and if specified a ``node.conf`` configuration file is then expected in the root of the workspace.

The configuration file templates used for the ``gradle deployNodes`` task are to be found in the ``/config/dev`` folder. Also note that there is a basic set of defaults loaded from
the built in resource file ``/node/src/main/resources/reference.conf`` of the ``:node`` gradle module. All properties in this can be overidden in the file configuration
and for rarely changed properties this defaulting allows the property to be excluded from the configuration file.

Configuration File Format
-------------------------

Corda uses the Typesafe configuration library to parse the configuration see the `typesafe config on Github <https://github.com/typesafehub/config/>`_  the format of the configuration files can be simple JSON, but for the more powerful substitution features
uses HOCON format see `HOCON documents <https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md>`_

Configuration File Examples
---------------------------

General node configuration file for hosting the IRSDemo services.

.. code-block:: text

    basedir : "./nodea"
    myLegalName : "Bank A"
    nearestCity : "London"
    keyStorePassword : "cordacadevpass"
    trustStorePassword : "trustpass"
    dataSourceProperties : {
       dataSourceClassName : org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource
       "dataSource.url" : "jdbc:h2:"${basedir}"/persistence"
       "dataSource.user" : sa
       "dataSource.password" : ""
    }
    artemisAddress : "localhost:31337"
    webAddress : "localhost:31339"
    extraAdvertisedServiceIds: "corda.interest_rates"
    networkMapAddress : "localhost:12345"
    useHTTPS : false
    rpcUsers : [
        { user=user1, password=letmein, permissions=[ cash ] }
    ]

NetworkMapService plus Simple Notary configuration file.

.. code-block:: text

    basedir : "./nameserver"
    myLegalName : "Notary Service"
    nearestCity : "London"
    keyStorePassword : "cordacadevpass"
    trustStorePassword : "trustpass"
    artemisAddress : "localhost:12345"
    webAddress : "localhost:12346"
    extraAdvertisedServiceIds: ""
    useHTTPS : false

Configuration File Fields
-------------------------

:basedir: This specifies the node workspace folder either as an absolute path, or relative to the current working directory. It can be overidden by the ``--base-directory`` command line option, in which case the the value in the file is ignored and a ``node.conf`` file is expected in that workspace directory as the configuration source.

:myLegalName: The legal identity of the node acts as a human readable alias to the node's public key and several demos use this to lookup the NodeInfo.

:nearestCity: The location of the node as used to locate coordinates on the world map when running the network simulator demo. See :doc:`network-simulator`.

:keyStorePassword:
    The password to unlock the KeyStore file (``<workspace>/certificates/sslkeystore.jks``) containing the node certificate and private key.

    note:: This is the non-secret value for the development certificates automatically generated during the first node run. Longer term these keys will be managed in secure hardware devices.

:trustStorePassword:
    The password to unlock the Trust store file (``<workspace>/certificates/truststore.jks``) containing the R3 Corda root certificate. This is the non-secret value for the development certificates automatically generated during the first node run.

    .. note:: Longer term these keys will be managed in secure hardware devices.

:dataSourceProperties:
    This section is used to configure the jdbc connection and database driver used for the nodes persistence. Currently the defaults in ``/node/src/main/resources/reference.conf`` are as shown in the first example. This is currently the only configuration that has been tested, although in the future full support for other storage layers will be validated.

:artemisAddress:
    The host and port on which the node is available for protocol operations over ArtemisMQ.

    .. note:: In practice the ArtemisMQ messaging services bind to all local addresses on the specified port. However, note that the host is the included as the advertised entry in the NetworkMapService. As a result the value listed here must be externally accessible when running nodes across a cluster of machines.

:messagingServerAddress:
    The address of the ArtemisMQ broker instance. If not provided the node will run one locally.

:webAddress:
    The host and port on which the node is available for web operations.

    .. note:: If HTTPS is enabled then the browser security checks will require that the accessing url host name is one of either the machine name, fully qualified machine name, or server IP address to line up with the Subject Alternative Names contained within the development certificates. This is addition to requiring the ``/config/dev/corda_dev_ca.cer`` root certificate be installed as a Trusted CA.

:extraAdvertisedServiceIds: A list of ServiceType id strings to be advertised to the NetworkMapService and thus be available when other nodes query the NetworkMapCache for supporting nodes. This can also include plugin services loaded from .jar files in the plugins folder.

:notaryNodeAddress: The host and port to which to bind the embedded Raft server. Required only when running a distributed notary service. A group of Corda nodes can run a distributed notary service by each running an embedded Raft server and joining them to the same cluster to replicate the committed state log. Note that the Raft cluster uses a separate transport layer for communication that does not integrate with ArtemisMQ messaging services.

:notaryClusterAddresses: List of Raft cluster member addresses used to joining the cluster. At least one of the specified members must be active and be able to communicate with the cluster leader for joining. If empty, a new cluster will be bootstrapped. Required only when running a distributed notary service.

:networkMapAddress: If `null`, or missing the node is declaring itself as the NetworkMapService host. Otherwise the configuration value is the remote HostAndPort string for the ArtemisMQ service on the hosting node.

:useHTTPS: If false the node's web server will be plain HTTP. If true the node will use the same certificate and private key from the ``<workspace>/certificates/sslkeystore.jks`` file as the ArtemisMQ port for HTTPS. If HTTPS is enabled then unencrypted HTTP traffic to the node's **webAddress** port is not supported.

:rpcUsers:
    A list of users who are authorised to access the RPC system. Each user in the list is a config object with the
    following fields:

        :user: Username consisting only of word characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and _)
        :password: The password
        :permissions: A list of permission strings which RPC methods can use to control access

    If this field is absent or an empty list then RPC is effectively locked down.

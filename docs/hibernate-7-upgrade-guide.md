# Upgrading to Hibernate 7 (Corda 4.15)

> **DRAFT.** Written in this repository so that it travels with the change (ENT-15178). It is intended to be ported to the
> [corda-docs](https://github.com/corda/corda-docs) repository. Sections marked **[VERIFY]** need confirming by the doc/QA team
> against a supported-platform matrix that this draft could not test (see [Testing status](#testing-status-remove-before-publishing)).

Corda 4.15 upgrades its object-relational mapper from Hibernate ORM 5.6 (end of life) to **Hibernate ORM 7.4.12.Final**.
Hibernate 6 and later implement *Jakarta* Persistence rather than *Java EE* Persistence, so the persistence annotations that
CorDapps use for their vault schemas move from the `javax.persistence` package to the `jakarta.persistence` package.

## Who needs to do what

| You are...                                    | What you need to do                                                                                              |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **A node operator**                           | Nothing to your node configuration or database. Check your database version is supported, and deploy CorDapps built for 4.15. |
| **A CorDapp developer** (with a custom schema)| Port your schema classes to `jakarta.persistence`, rebuild, and re-sign. A script helps with most of it.        |
| **A CorDapp developer** (no custom schema)    | Nothing, unless your code calls `ServiceHub.withEntityManager` or uses Hibernate or JPA classes directly.        |

**There is no database migration.** Corda 4.15 does not add, change or remove any table, column, index or sequence as part of this
upgrade, and Liquibase has no new changesets for it. Hibernate 7 has been configured to read and write the formats that existing
databases already use (see [What stays the same](#what-stays-the-same-in-the-database)). You do not need to run
`run-migration-scripts` for this change.

---

## For node operators

### 1. Check your database version

Hibernate 7 raised the minimum database versions it supports. **[VERIFY]** against the Corda 4.15 supported-platforms list.

| Database                | Minimum version supported by Hibernate 7 |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| PostgreSQL              | 13                                       |
| Oracle                  | 19c                                      |
| Microsoft SQL Server    | 2012 (11.0); Azure SQL supported         |
| H2 (development only)   | 2.1.214                                  |

Older versions may start, but Hibernate no longer tests against them and may generate SQL they do not support. If you run an older
version, upgrade the database *before* upgrading the node. Use a current JDBC driver for your database.

### 2. Deploy CorDapps built for Corda 4.15

A CorDapp whose schema was compiled against `javax.persistence` cannot be used by Hibernate 7. The node detects this when it starts
and **refuses to start**, with a message that names the offending class, for example:

```
The class com.example.MyState$PersistentMyState of the schema com.example.MySchemaV1 was built for Corda 4.14 or earlier, as it uses the
javax.persistence annotations. Corda 4.15 uses Hibernate 7, which requires jakarta.persistence. The CorDapp that contains the schema
needs to be rebuilt for Corda 4.15 ...
```

Nothing is changed in the database when this happens. Obtain updated CorDapps from their vendors (or see the next section if you build
them yourself) **before** starting the node on 4.15. CorDapps that have no custom schema are not affected by this check.

### 3. Things you may notice

* The log shows messages such as `HHH90006001: Setting 'hibernate.id.db_structure_naming_strategy' is still incubating`
  once per Hibernate session factory at start-up. They are informational. **[VERIFY]** whether these should be silenced by default.
* If your database does not match what Corda expects, start-up fails with `HibernateSchemaChangeException` and the reason, exactly as
  before. Run the node with the `run-migration-scripts` sub-command, or contact support.
* The `--allow-hibernate-to-manage-app-schema` option (development only) still creates *missing* tables and columns, but, as before,
  does **not** alter existing ones. (Hibernate 7's own `update` mode would alter existing columns; Corda deliberately turns that off.)

### Rolling back

This upgrade changes no database structure, so the database can be used with the previous version of the node. CorDapps must be
rolled back with it.

## For CorDapp developers

### 1. What changes

| Hibernate 5 / Corda 4.14                                         | Hibernate 7 / Corda 4.15                                              |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `import javax.persistence.*`                                      | `import jakarta.persistence.*`                                        |
| `javax.persistence:javax.persistence-api:2.2`                     | `jakarta.persistence:jakarta.persistence-api:3.2.0`                   |
| `org.hibernate:hibernate-core:5.x`                                | `org.hibernate.orm:hibernate-core:7.4.12.Final`                       |
| `@Type(type = "uuid-char")`                                       | `@JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.VARCHAR)`                                     |
| `@Type(type = "corda-wrapper-binary")`                            | `@JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.VARBINARY)`                                   |
| `session.save(x)`                                                 | `session.persist(x)`                                                  |
| `session.update(x)`, `session.saveOrUpdate(x)`                    | `session.merge(x)`                                                    |
| `session.delete(x)`                                               | `session.remove(x)`                                                   |
| `javax.persistence.EntityManager` in `serviceHub.withEntityManager {}` | `jakarta.persistence.EntityManager`                              |

### 2. Use the migration script

`tools/scripts/migrate-cordapp-to-hibernate7.sh` applies the mechanical changes above to your source tree (Kotlin, Java, Gradle) and
then lists everything that still needs a human decision.

```bash
tools/scripts/migrate-cordapp-to-hibernate7.sh --dry-run path/to/your/cordapp   # show what would change
tools/scripts/migrate-cordapp-to-hibernate7.sh path/to/your/cordapp             # apply, then review the report
```

It is safe to run twice. Always review the diff and run your tests.

### 3. Changes the script cannot make for you

**HQL and JPQL are validated strictly.** Hibernate 5 passed anything it did not recognise straight through to the database; Hibernate 7
rejects it with `SemanticException`.

```kotlin
// Before: tx_id is a column name. Rejected by Hibernate 7.
"from MyEntity where tx_id = :id"
// After: use the attribute name.
"from MyEntity where txId = :id"

// Before: compared an association to the id of the target entity. Rejected by Hibernate 7.
"... join Blob blob on checkpoint.blob = blob.id"
// After: compare the association to the entity.
"... join Blob blob on checkpoint.blob = blob"
```

**Custom Hibernate types.** `@Type(type = "...")`, `@TypeDef` and the `org.hibernate.type.*TypeDescriptor` classes no longer exist.
Use `@JdbcTypeCode`, `@JdbcType` / `@JavaType`, or a JPA `AttributeConverter`.

**Stricter mappings.** For example `@OrderColumn` is only allowed on a `java.util.List`, not a `Set`.

**Result order.** A query with no `ORDER BY` has no defined order. Hibernate 7 renders some queries differently (for example an
`IN` over a composite key), so a database may now return rows in a different order. Add an explicit sort.

**Duplicate `persist`.** Persisting a second entity with the same id in the same session now fails immediately with
`EntityExistsException`, and marks the transaction for rollback. Previously `save` threw `NonUniqueObjectException`, which did not
mark the transaction for rollback.

**Constraint violations.** A duplicate-key violation that was reported as a `PersistenceException` wrapping a
`ConstraintViolationException` is now reported as the `ConstraintViolationException` itself (which is itself a
`PersistenceException`). Code that catches `PersistenceException` is unaffected.

### 4. Rebuilding, signing and versioning

The persistence annotations are part of your state classes' bytecode, so the CorDapp jar that contains them changes. Treat the
result as a new CorDapp version:

* Increase the CorDapp version number.
* Sign it with the **same key** as before. States using a signature constraint continue to verify.
* States using a **hash constraint** are pinned to the old jar and need the usual constraint-migration (contract upgrade) process.
* If you keep contracts and states in a jar separate from your flows, only the jar containing the schema classes needs to change.

### 5. Testing

`MockNetwork`, `MockServices` and the driver run against H2 and let Hibernate create the tables of your own schemas, as before.
Test your CorDapp against **every database you support**. If you can, run your integration tests against PostgreSQL, SQL Server and
Oracle: Hibernate's mapping of some Java types differs between databases.

### 6. A CorDapp you cannot rebuild

If you only have the compiled jar of a third-party CorDapp, the
[Eclipse Transformer](https://github.com/eclipse/transformer) can rewrite its `javax.persistence` references:

```bash
printf 'javax.persistence=jakarta.persistence\n' > rename.properties
java -cp 'org.eclipse.transformer.cli-1.0.0.jar:...' org.eclipse.transformer.cli.TransformerCLI cordapp.jar cordapp-jakarta.jar -tr rename.properties
```

This **only** renames the package. It cannot convert `@Type(type = "...")`, so it is only suitable for CorDapps without those annotations,
and the jar must be re-signed afterwards, with the same constraints implications as above. Prefer asking the vendor for a 4.15 build.

## What stays the same in the database

Hibernate 6 and 7 changed several defaults. Corda sets the following properties so that the data formats used by existing
databases and CorDapps do **not** change. You do not need to set or change any of them.

| Behaviour that changed in Hibernate 6+                                                 | How Corda keeps the Hibernate 5 behaviour                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `@GeneratedValue` uses a sequence per entity (`foo_SEQ`), incrementing by 50           | `hibernate.id.db_structure_naming_strategy=legacy` and `hibernate.id.sequence.increment_size_mismatch_strategy=FIX`: the single `hibernate_sequence` with an increment of 1 is still used |
| `Instant` is stored as `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` and read using the database session's time zone | `hibernate.type.preferred_instant_jdbc_type=TIMESTAMP`: stored as a UTC `TIMESTAMP`, independent of the database server's time zone |
| `UUID` is stored in the database's native type (`uuid`, `uniqueidentifier`, `raw(16)`) | `hibernate.type.preferred_uuid_jdbc_type=BINARY` (PostgreSQL: `UUID`): as in Hibernate 5    |
| Oracle `double`/`float` are `BINARY_DOUBLE`/`BINARY_FLOAT`                              | `hibernate.dialect.oracle.use_binary_floats=false`                                        |
| `hbm2ddl=update` also alters existing columns                                          | A Corda schema-management tool that only creates what is missing                          |

Corda's own `@Type` mappings are preserved:

| Hibernate 5 type         | Hibernate 7 mapping                                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `uuid-char`              | `@JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.VARCHAR)` (still stored as 36 characters)                                  |
| `corda-wrapper-binary`   | `@JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.VARBINARY)`                                                                 |
| `corda-blob`             | A Corda JDBC type code: a regular BLOB, except `bytea` on PostgreSQL (needed for checkpoints)       |

## Frequently asked questions

**Do I have to run any database scripts?** No. This upgrade does not change the database.

**Can the fix for CorDapps be put in the node's migration files?** No, and it is not needed. Liquibase changesets change the
database; the CorDapp problem is in compiled code (annotations in a jar). The node cannot rewrite a CorDapp's code through a database
migration. What *can* be, and is, handled in the node is every database-visible difference (see the table above).

**Will my vault data still be readable?** Yes. The vault tables, and the formats of their columns, are unchanged.

**Does my CorDapp need Hibernate 7 on its classpath?** Only if it uses Hibernate classes directly (for example `@JdbcTypeCode`).
The node provides Hibernate; declare it `cordaProvided`/compile-only in your build, as you did for Hibernate 5.

## Testing status (remove before publishing)

Verified by the engineer who made the change (branch `adel/ENT-15178`):

* **Unit tests on H2**: the full `node`, `node-api`, `node-api-tests`, `core-tests` and `finance` suites (2,342 tests). Every failure was
  compared with the unmodified 4.15 baseline run in the same environment, and **none is caused by this change**:
  the TLS/X.509 tests (17 failures in `node`, `node-api` and `node-api-tests`) fail identically on the baseline; the flow tests in `core-tests`
  (`ReceiveMultipleFlowTests`, `ReferencedStatesFlowTests`, `FlowSleepTest`, `ReceiveFinalityFlowTest`) fail in the same way in a full baseline
  run (13 failures) and pass when run on their own on both; and a Raft notary test timed out once in a full run and passes on its own.
* **PostgreSQL 16** (embedded, real server): 729 tests from the persistence, vault, identity, network-map, key and migration suites. The only
  failures are tests that fail identically on the Hibernate 5 baseline against PostgreSQL, because they assume H2 (a test that re-opens a
  database by name, an unordered `GROUP BY`, and the TLS tests).
* A database created by the Liquibase scripts is opened by Hibernate in strict `validate` mode (what a production node does) on both H2 and
  PostgreSQL, with the JVM in a non-UTC time zone. `Instant` values are stored as UTC wall-clock `timestamp` values, `UUID` and `hibernate_sequence`
  behave as before.
* The "built for Corda 4.14" start-up check was verified against the genuine Corda 4.12 `finance-contracts` jar.
* The migration script was run on unmodified Hibernate 5 sources and produced the same result as the hand conversion in this change.

**Not tested** (no environment available): Microsoft SQL Server, Azure SQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL versions other than 16. Hibernate 7
maps some Java types differently on these databases, and it is where an unnoticed difference is most likely. These need to be run by QA, against
a database created by a 4.14 node (not a fresh one) with a populated vault, **before release**. In particular check: startup in `validate` mode
(no `HibernateSchemaChangeException`), `Instant` columns, `UUID` columns, and the checkpoint tables on each database.
